# topic-modeling-and-tf-idf-analysis

Data source: https://github.com/mhjabreel/CharCNN/tree/master/data/ag_news_csv

In this project, I perform tf-idf analysis and topic modeling for 120,000 news which are divided into 4 labels Business, Sport
Sci-Tech and World. For each topic, I will:
1. Conduct tf-idf analysis to find which words are associated most with the labels.
2. Perform topic modeling to find unsupervisedly sub-topics by using LDA method.

Two of objectives above could be used for a model that predicts labels or recommends related news.
